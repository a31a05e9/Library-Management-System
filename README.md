       "LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM" 
This code is written in PYTHON using OOPS concept.
This solution implements a set of classes for the Library Management System.  The Book class represents a book, with attributes for title, author, ID, and availability. 
The Library class represents the library itself, containing a list of books and members. 
The Member class represents a library member, with attributes for ID, name, subscription status, and a list of borrowed books.
The Library class includes methods for adding books and members, finding a specific book or member, borrowing a book, and returning a book.
Each operation checks the necessary conditions before proceeding. For example, a book can only be borrowed if it is available and the member is subscribed.
The code is modular and reusable, with each class representing a single concept and implementing related functionality. 
This design promotes maintainability and scalability, as new features or changes can be implemented or made without affecting other parts of the code.
